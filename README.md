# FarmGrow-Crop-Disease-Detection-Webapp

Our proposed mining approach used pre-trained deep CNN architecture, VGG-16 as the backbone for the image classification on Plant Village Dataset and HTML, CSS, JS along with Python programming language to create a web-based crop disease detection tool.

It is observed that the testing accuracy of VGG-16 model is 92.15%. Though in this study the data was unbalanced. Here, AUC (Area Under the Curve) value is 0.71 which implies a good predictive power of model. 
In future, further model and further AI techniques can be applied. Here, main concern was the availability of data so, we will use FL approach in the future.
